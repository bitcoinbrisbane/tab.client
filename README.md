UnOffical Client for https://www.tab.com.au/

## About
Tab.com.au have an application process to query their api https://help.tab.com.au/s/article/Applying-for-TAB-Studio-API-access  After numerous phone calls with TAB and them not knowing what their own API was they rejected my application.

Therefor, I had to reverse engineer their site and created a c# client library.
